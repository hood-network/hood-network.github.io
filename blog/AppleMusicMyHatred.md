## Apple Music, you aren't bad...

I personally don't hate Apple Music, it has a lot of good songs and I'm really a sucker for the [lossless](https://support.apple.com/en-us/118295#:~:text=Most%20audio%20compression%20techniques%20lose,Lossless%20Audio%20Codec%20(ALAC).) format they deliver. Compared to FLAC, as far as I'm aware, **there shouldn't be any difference in quality**, although, a quick listen on TIDAL, the holy grail of lossless songs made me think a bit different. The audio was "warmer" and "clearer", but that _might_ have been an user error because I was fiddling with some Dolby configs at that time. 😥

Leaving audio quality aside, I absolutely **HATE** the Apple Music Desktop application, atleast on Windows. _SOMEHOW_ we _still_ don't have [Sing Lyrics](https://www.apple.com/pt/newsroom/2022/12/apple-introduces-apple-music-sing/) in the actual app, it is only on Android and other [Apple Devices](https://www.apple.com/pt/newsroom/2022/12/apple-introduces-apple-music-sing/#:~:text=and%20can%20be%20enjoyed%20on%20iPhone) and we have to resort to third-party apps like Cider, where we lose features such as crossfade and even lossless audio (fun fact: [you can't even use lossless with crossfade](https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleMusic/comments/1k9vd6q/hey_does_crossfade_work_for_you_guys_apple_music/), it won't work)

## ..but you could be better!

Here comes my savior! [Cider](https://cidercollective.itch.io/cider)! Cider is a third party Apple Music client made for Windows, MacOS and Linux. Think of it like Spotify with [Spicetify](https://spicetify.app/), that's pretty much what Cider is for Apple Music, just that **it doesn't go on top of Apple Music**, it's a whole different app. 

Cider not only brings me the feature I really like from Apple Music (spoiler alert: it's Sing Lyrics), it also gives Apple Music a whole new redesign.

Oh yeah, here's how Apple Music looks on my Windows!

Let's address the elephant in the room. **Sing Lyrics**. I've mentioned how Apple Music doesn't have such things, and it's true! I personally don't mind losing crossfade and lossless audio for Sing Lyrics. **They're so pretty!!** I can finally become an Anime Girl that sings in her own room!... well.. my voice still kinda sucks but hey! (as a straight male, my fantasy is singing like an Anime Girl >..< )

~thank you screenpal, i have no other hoster bro </3~

Sure, it isn't **truly** Sing Lyrics, I believe those lyrics give you the ability the make the _actual_ voices quieter while playing the song. But hey! I can still sing alongside the voice! There's a bunch of other settings that you could tweak to make Cider yours truly, I will not share all those settings here though, if you want to check Cider out, feel free to do so, although, ⚠️⚠️==beware==⚠️⚠️, it's like 3bajillion dollars. (3 bucks)

If you _do_ use Apple Music alongside with the 3 other users of this app (me included btw), Cider **will** break crossfade and lossless, because Apple doesn't want us to enjoy those things. I'd say it's worth it, anyway.

thank you for coming to my short ted talk about how apple music sucky but cider good-y


p.s. i might make more posts here im bored anyway lol
